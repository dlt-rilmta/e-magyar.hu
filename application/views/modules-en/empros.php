            <h3><span>emPros</span> - Speech Prosody Analyser</h3>
            <h4>About the tool</h4>
            <h5>What is it good for? What does it do?</h5>
            <p>The program analyses and transcribes the intonation of verbal utterances in spontaneous communication. After the retrieval of the acoustic parameters from the archived recordings and their processing and stylization per speaker, it labels the utterances’ intonation relative to the participants’ individual range of voice. The program was designed mainly with the analysis of multi-member interactions in mind, but it can also be used to process texts read out loud, as well as monologues.</p>
            <h5>What is the input?</h5>
            <p>The audio file recording the conversation and a respective annotation, containing the temporal position of the utterances on a separate axis (annotation level) for each speaker. There are no restrictions concerning the number of speakers, the segmentation of the utterances or the content of the labels. Empty labels are interpreted as the speaker in question being silent.
            </p>
            <h5>What is the output?</h5>
            <p>The annotation returned as an output describes the utterances on four levels for each speaker. The first level tags the utterances into melody segments, assigning one of the five categories to each segment: "rise", "fall", "descending", "ascending", or "level". The second level places the starting and end points of the melody segments within the speaker’s individual voice range divided into five levels  (L2 &lt; L1 &lt; M &lt; H1 &lt; H2). 
                The third level connects the original values measured in Hertz to the relative values of the previous level. The fourth level separates the voiced ("V") and voiceless ("U") segments of the speech.</p>
            <h5>An example:</h5>
            <p>The sample in the source code’s <i>input</i> folder (<i>sample.wav</i>, <i>sample.TextGrid</i>) contains the archived recording of a dialogue (to preserve the speakers’ anonymity, only their intonation can be heard on the recording) as well as the utterances’ intervals per speaker ("speakerA" and "speakerB"). The output is the <i>sample_pitch.TextGrid</i> file in the <i>output</i> folder, containing the intonation of the utterances on 8 (4+4) annotation levels. Overlapping speech is not analysed.</p>
